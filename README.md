# Touhou 9: Phantasmagoria of Flower View Clone

![Game logo](images/1.ico)

This project is effectively a complete (although perhaps not perfect...) clone of the legendary and eponymous
2005 video game. I aim to reproduce and augment the features of the original, including netplay, replays, 3D
graphics, and AI. The project is written in `pygame` so can be run cross-platform by any machine.

## Running
As the project is currently in its early renditions, this section would be mistaken if it were named "How to play" or
something similar, since the game currently lacks any semblance of gameplay. However, you can launch into its limited
scope through the simple `python game.py`, which will boot up the window and allow you to start playing.
